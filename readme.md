# Storm Project

This project is a World Storms Blog, a web application that allows you to explore and share photographs of storms from around the world. It employs modern technologies on both the backend and frontend to provide a smooth and engaging user experience.

## Features

- User registration and login
- Create, edit, update, and delete personal storm posts
- Browse and search storm posts from other users

#### Backend

- **Node.js**: The backend is developed in Node.js, ensuring fast performance and scalability.
- **Express**: We use the Express framework to create a robust and efficient RESTful API.
- **MongoDB**: The database is built on MongoDB, a NoSQL database that allows flexible data storage and management.
- **Authentication**: Users can securely register and log in. We use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
- **CRUD**: We implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage storm photographs. Users can create, edit, and delete their own posts.

#### Frontend

- **ReactJS**: The user interface is built with ReactJS, an open-source JavaScript framework developed by Facebook.
- **Redux**: We use Redux to efficiently manage the application's state and maintain a smooth user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes for an optimal user experience.
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload storm images along with a title, location, and description.
- **Editing and Deletion**: Users can edit and delete their own posts.
